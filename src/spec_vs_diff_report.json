  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all five requirements. Password-based authentication has been removed in favor of username-only login. The backend enforces that 'Alaie' is reserved for admin access only, preventing guests from using it. A conditional Display Name field appears on the login page when the username is 'Alaie', allowing admins to set their display name. The frontend displays the admin's display name in chat messages, profile, and conversation list with appropriate fallback to 'Alaie'. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the code changes.",
