  "summary": "The diff shows backend changes removing subscription logic and preserving messaging functionality, but lacks evidence of frontend UI changes required by REQ-13. The backend appears to implement unrestricted messaging features (REQ-14, REQ-15), though complete verification is limited by truncated project_state.json.",
