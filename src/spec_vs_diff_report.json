  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements for removing profile picture upload from the login screen. The LoginPage.tsx no longer renders ProfilePictureUpload component, the backend now accepts optional profilePicture (migration added to handle existing data), and the frontend mutation hook sends only displayName without profilePicture data. All changes align with the BuildRequest constraints: ProfilePictureUpload.tsx component is preserved (not removed), backend profilePicture field remains optional, and display logic in other components (Header, ChatNavigation, MessageList, PrivateConversation) continues to support profiles with pictures.",

      "description": "Added backend migration system (backend/migration.mo) to transform old user profiles with 'name' field to new profiles with 'displayName' field",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not mention creating a migration system or changing the field name from 'name' to 'displayName'. This appears to be a refactoring that goes beyond the specified requirements.",
