# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all subscription and payment functionality to make the Alatele messaging app completely free for all users.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all subscription, payment, and premium tier UI elements from frontend components
- Remove subscription and payment-related backend logic, data models, and API endpoints
- Ensure all messaging features (send, edit, delete) are unrestricted and available to all users

**User-visible outcome:** All users can access the full messaging functionality without any subscription prompts, payment gates, or feature restrictions.
